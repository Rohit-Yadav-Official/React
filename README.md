# React
# Virtual DOM
In React, the "virtual DOM" refers to a programming concept and optimization technique used to improve the performance of updating the user interface. The virtual DOM is not specific to React but is a common approach in many modern web development frameworks.

Here's a brief overview of how the virtual DOM works in React:

**Actual DOM vs. Virtual DOM:**

The "actual DOM" is the real, physical representation of the HTML structure in the browser.
The "virtual DOM" is an abstraction of the actual DOM, maintained in memory by React.
Reconciliation Process:

When there's a change in the state or props of a React component, React doesn't immediately update the actual DOM.
Instead, it first updates the virtual DOM with the new state or props.
Then, it compares the updated virtual DOM with a snapshot of the previous virtual DOM (before the update).
Diffing Algorithm:

React uses a "diffing" algorithm to identify the differences between the new virtual DOM and the previous one.
It calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM based on these differences.
Minimizing DOM Manipulations:

After identifying the differences, React calculates the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM.
It then updates only the parts of the actual DOM that changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
Performance Benefits:

By minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM and efficiently updating only the necessary parts, React can achieve better performance compared to directly manipulating the entire DOM for every change.

#reconciliation
The reconciliation process involves comparing the updated virtual DOM with a previous snapshot of the virtual DOM (before the update). React uses a diffing algorithm during this comparison to identify the differences between the two virtual DOMs. Once the differences are determined, React calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM based on these changes.

**The goal of reconciliation is to minimize the number of manipulations required to update the UI**. By identifying the specific changes in the virtual DOM, React can update only the parts of the actual DOM that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This approach helps improve the performance of React applications.
